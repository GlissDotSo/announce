Setup your own geth-compatible chain.















What is fucking cool?
- issuing your own token.
- NFT's as cryptomedia objects.



I'd love to curate different objects into a gallery
this requires a gallery format
but I'd also just like to design social tools for crypto e.g.
    a group that converts culture into NFT's
        screenshots
            bitcoin whitepaper
            etc.
        vote to mint
        mint
        sell




the thing is
the blockchain has enough space
we can subsidize the costs of infra
it's just that the indexer will not keep up with these demands
so we need to write our own indexing infra





Shitposting group.
Every post is a collectible meme NFT for 24h. 
Group is a DAO, every member has voting shares. How to accrue? 
    User collects $SHIT every time other group members "collect" their post.
What do $SHIT tokens govern?
    Group name.
    Add/remove member.
    Add/remove membership based on NFT.
        e.g. $POOLSUITE gives you access to group.
    Group can issue its own NFT's under its brand.
        e.g. collabs with other groups





Group
Post
    Comments
    [collect]
Poll
    Comments
    Vote - based on follow NFT of group.
    Deadline/execute.


Feeds within group
Membership of stream based on group membership token
But governance can authorise other tokens too











What use are follow NFT's? 





Cryptomedia needs to stream itself.



What needs UX?
 * snapshot polls.



Crazy features:

 * post NFT

 * snapshot polls in-app.

 * post data that uses on-chain call. e.g.
    ```eth
    makerdao_contract 
        address: 0x1123213123
        abi:
         - stabilityFee(address asset)
    
    timestamp = 123123123
    asset = 0x12312312
    stability_fee = makerdao_contract.stabilityFee(asset, { timestamp })
    return stability_fee
    ```

    replace truth!!


 * feeds that are token-gated.
    custom author module.
        isAuthor = holds token
        show the code on the homepage


 * revenue models for feeds
    * collect post for fee - on-chain svg of post.


 * streaming payments


 * tokenised engagement into $TOKEN.
   


 * feed for the hyper protocol
Can we somehow build hyper but using text-only? 

 
    


Basic features:

 * comments
 * mirrors
