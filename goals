Higher-level goals:

- Build products and UX that needs to exist.



Goals:

Finish off the Inbox prototype.
    Rewrite UI as the original wireframe skeleton.
Improve the UX.
    Pagination.
Launch it.
    Meta transaction layer.



Then:

Create the Gliss feed prototype.
Token-gated social feeds.
Really the killer feature is influence- the ability to trade one's influence and amass a following.
This is something only possible with Starkware.
